Add support for JSX.

For the purposes of this demo, we have to load babel, which adds in the JSX
syntax to JavaScript and dynamically parses scripts of type text/babel and
converts them to JavaScript. In a production application, there would instead
be an offline build pipeline that converts the JSX to JavaScript before sending
it to the client, and it wouldn't be necessary to server the Babel JS
directly.

<script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
<!-- 
Add support for React (allows writing JavaScript to create a render tree
from JSX).

Add support for ReactDOM (allows updating the DOM from the React render tree).

Note: This importmap specifies a dev version of React and ReactDOM.
A production application would "compile" these into a more optimized form
and maybe bundle them into one script.

  // Define component-global state for whether the popover has been opened at
  // least once.

  // Note: all state that affects react rendering must be in a component-global
  // or input parameter, even if that state is also represented in the browser
  // internals, because otherwise React will get out of sync with the browser.
  // Also, if we wanted |popoverOpened| to be kept up-to-date with whether the
  // popover was actually opened, then we'd have to add special code to listen
  // for the `toggle` browser event on the popover (in our case we don't
  // happen to need that, but a real application probably would).
  const [popoverOpened, setPopoverOpened] = useState(false);

  // Define global state for the popover HTML contents.

  // Note: this is not how a React site would in general be implemented with
  // React best practices, because the content HTML's structure would be
  // invisible to React and might cause problems because React doesn't
  // understand it, potentially leading to event handling bugs (because React
  // proxies all input events for its controlled subtree under #root through
  // its own mechanisms). This can be fixed by creating a client-side React
  // render template for the popover's structured HTML contents, and filing it
  // in with JSON parameters returned by the server. In our case, the response
  // from the server is just some innerText, so it's ok.
  const [popoverContent, setPopoverContent] = useState(null);

  // Declare a side-effect function for loading from the server, and that
  // depends on the |popoverOpened| global state variable (see second parameter
  // to useEffect).

  // Note: all application logic that happens outside of React's control needs
  // to be defined as side-effects so they can be replayed if necessary.
  //
  // Note: the |ignore| variable and boilerplate code is necessary to deal with
  // the fact that the |loadPopoverContent| function is async. See:
